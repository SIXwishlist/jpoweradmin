Installation Requirements
================================================================================

To successfully build and install JPower Admin, you will need the 
following software:

1. Java 5 or 6 (either OpenJDK or Oracle - JDK 1.5 or 1.6)
2. JBoss Seam 2.x (JPowerAdmin uses the SEAM freamework)
3. RESTEasy 2.x.x (Used for the remote management API)
4. Suitable application server (default config works with Jboss 5.x.x)
5. Ant version 1.7 or later
6. Exim MTA (version 4.6 or later) for e-mail forwarding

Building Instruction
================================================================================

The default configuration of JPower Admin works with Jboss Application Server 
version 5.x. To use JPowerAdmin out of the box, you will need a properly 
configured JBoss server version 5.x.

Please note that the default installation of Jboss is *insecure* and it is 
*your* responsibility to have a properly secured environment if you have 
JPower Admin running on a publicly accessible server.

To run JPowerAdmin on an application server other than JBoss, you will need to 
perform minor configuration changes and adjust the ant build script accordingly.
Refer to:

http://docs.jboss.org/seam/2.2.0.GA/en-US/html/weblogic.html
http://docs.jboss.org/seam/2.2.0.GA/en-US/html/websphere.html
http://docs.jboss.org/seam/2.2.0.GA/en-US/html/glassfish.html

for the configuration changes necessary for these servers.

Extract the dependant software to a directory of your choice. 

Open the ant build script "build.xml" and change the following properties:


* lib.dir
* rest-easy-lib.dir
* jboss-home.dir

lib.dir refers to the "lib" directory of the seam framework.

rest-easy-lib.dir refers to the "lib" directory of RESTEasy.

jboss-home.dir refers to the location of JBOSS.

Assuming the prerequisites are met and the ant build script has been modified 
to reflect your setup, issue command in the directory with the build.xml file.

~ant ear

If there are no errors outputted, congratulations, you have successfully 
built JPowerAdmin! You can find the ear archive under the dist directory.

Deployment
================================================================================
Before deploying the ear archive, you need to configure the DataSource. Under 
the "resources" directory, you will find the JPowerAdmin-ds.xml file specifying 
the database connection properties. The default data source is for HSQL and will 
work out of the box on JBoss. It is only for testing the actual interface and 
it will *not* work with PowerDNS. Edit the file accordingly. You will need to 
change at least the "connection-url" and the "driver-class" properties in the 
data source configuration. Additionally, you will need to change the 
"hibernate-dialect" property in the "persistence.xml" file. Examples for 
MySQL are commented out.

In any case, you *must* have the correct JDBC driver installed for database in 
question. After the data source is configured correctly, you can install the
data source by issuing the  following command:

~# ant datasource

To deploy the the ear archive, invoke the "deploy" target.

~# ant deploy  

Navigate to 

http://yourhost:8080/JPowerAdmin

and enjoy the software.

Fancy Record Support
================================================================================
PowerDNS supports the so called fancy records that perform e-mail forwarding and 
URL redirection. To use these features, we need supporting software that 
performs the URL redirection or the e-mail forwarding.

URL Redirection
================================================================================
To use URL redirection, you need to build the URL redirection servlet. 

Navigate to the "JPowerAdmin-URL-Redirection-Servlet" directory under the 
"fancyrecord" directory. You will need to adjust the following properties in the 
and build script:

* seam.dir
* JPowerAdmin.dir

After verifying that the ant build script has the correct properties set, invoke 
the war target.

~# ant war

The URL redirection servlet is built. You must deploy the resulting ROOT.war 
archive in a separate IP-based virtual host. Then set the urlredirector config
option in powerDNS. Please refer to the PowerDNS manual (link below) 
for more information.

E-mail forwarding
================================================================================
The email forwarding functionality is provided by the exim MTA. Download and 
install the exim MTA version 4.6 or later. Use the configuration file provided 
in the "fancyrecords" directory. 

WARNING: the provided exim4.conf file assumes that your server is securely 
configured for running an MTA service exposed to the general public.
